I apologize for not notifying about my
presence on the control room, but I hope 
Miss Yurinka has not forgotten about the appointment
&music OGG/VAN.OGG


we have today in the river of BaltycMorsk with
our patron, to discuss the continuity of the funding
of our great mission.

...
...
Yurinka: eh...



... of course Markus! I was preparing myself
for this moment. I was not planning on spending the
rest of the evening watching RadioTube while snacking



or taking a nap. The mission of our organization is the
only thing that occupies my mind night and day!
And what were you doing the whole day, anyways?



Markus: I shall inform, Miss Yurinka, about the activities
I conducted today during my workday, as requested:




1. As per request of Miss Ola, 
I went to the State Monopoly shop to adquire
two units of BisonGrass spirit drink.



2. I deposit the units requested on the fridge
down the corridor. Then I proceeded to clean up 
a deceased mouse that started decomposing next to the sofa.



Unfortunately, we forgot to provision a trash bin so I
decided to also place the inert rodent on the same fridge,
as the low temperatures would slow down its decay until



we could get enough funds from our Patron to provision a 
container for disposal of biological rests...




Yurinka: Yikes! I am going to puke if you keep going.
I think it was enough information for today.
What's the plan with the patron?



Markus: Pardon me Miss Yurinka, but didn't you just say
you spent today's day preparing for the meeting?




Yurinka: You are supposed to take care of the security
of the perimeter, not to act as Ola's personal assistant!
Tell me the details of the mission!



Markus: We have an appointment on BaltycMorsk's river marina
in exactly 42 minutes. The patron has good news: We have 
a clear action plan to start dismantling the regime.



His messenger will meet us on the Marina to communicate
his action plan privately. In order to not draw attention from
the network of city cameras, we will pass as



the catering of a Yacht party.

Yurinka: Did you forget none of us has a driving license?



Markus: Miss Ola passed the exams successfully on her 8th attempt
last week. We finally can stop commuting on bycicle during missions.
The patron has even provided us with a rental vehicle for the enterprise.



Yurinka: May god be with us...

Markus: We are awaiting Miss Ola to appear with the van.
Ideally, we should take less than ten minutes to arrive
to the city center. 



Yurinka: This is assuming we don't crash.
Hold a second. What was the BisonGrass for if Ola already
knew she would have to drive today???
&background IMG/MOT002.PCX


Jeez! That's a current year van. I am no expert 
on these things, but it feels as if we really got a boost
of budget from the patron.



Markus: Miss, it seems you have again failed to pay 
attention to the intel I provided. This van is only a
temporary lease for this particular mission.



Yurinka: So back to riding bycicles we go...
The pittance I earn won't get me to even pay a basic
Motoreczka. I would look ridiculous riding that tho.



Markus: In my honest opinion, I think it would be
appropiate for the lady's dimensions.




Yurinka: Who are you calling a midget, you albino gorilla?
Let's cut the chatter and see how long we take to end 
up with our bowels spread on the highway.
&background IMG/MOT003.PCX


Yurinka: Wow! We could travel to the dark sea
on this van. If the government ever issued us a permit
to leave the country, that is...



And by the way... here is our driver.


&sprite IMG/SPROLA.PCX


Nice outfit Ola! 
Do you fancy a coffee to recover from the 
bottle you gulped down a couple of hours ago?



Ola: I only took a couple of shots, then spent
the rest of the day studying today's plan.
If we can't convince the patron today to 



Keep his funding, it's over for the organization,
the base and the mission. You spend the day bitching
about how improductive we are, but what have you done



today apart from watching propaganda and reviewing
conspiracy theory videocassettes about "that" accident?
You are always avoiding to participate in operations!



Yurinka: These are not conspiracy theories! 
And I am about to crack the security of radionet's channel
7, which is what the patron assigned me!



Ola: You have spent the last six months pretending
that you are trying to crack RadioNet, but so far 
you have not shown us any progress. We both know



the only reason you belong to this organization is
that you have family bonds with people from the
government. You are sabotaging our mission!



Yurinka: How dare you? You harpy!
I admit I have not been the most productive lately,
but why do you question my commitment to the cause?



You know what? I am going to carry this mission
without your help! I will request the patron for
you to be replaced.



Ola: Markus! Tell this entitled bitch to stop
thinking she is the leader of our movement!

&background IMG/MOT003.PCX
&sprite IMG/SPRMAR.PCX

Markus: I think, ladies, that we don't have
the human resources or time to engage on this
kind of fratricide discussion...



the government is behaving erratically and
we have a golden chance in our hands to deal them
them the grace blow, but we need to remain
&background IMG/MOT004.PCX


united despite our personal differences...
Otherwise, we all have a personal life to attend,
and we might aswell abandon this mission.



Yurinka: Whatever...
I won't apology to this venomous viper,
but you have a point, the mission is our priority.



Ola: Do you want me to crash the van into the
bridge and take us all together?




Yurinka: I am surprised you have not done so
already, you bottle guzzler...

&background IMG/MOT005.PCX


Ola: Markus! Tell this old prick to stop
insulting my persona!




Markus: Calm down ladies. We are almost 
at the destination. Kindly settle your differences
for the next quarter of hour.



Yurinka: (I think I should have come with 
empty stomach after all... this girl is driving
like a maniac and I feel terrible) 
&stopambiance


At least we arrived to the destination 
on one piece. 

&background IMG/MOT007.PCX


Markus: Ahead, as planned. The messenger should arrive in
around 10 minutes. Miss Ola has driven faster than estimated.
Yurinka, could you please use the communicator to



verify that no transmission might be spying our conversations
or reporting our locations?
We could all land in jail if sensitive information



ends up in the hands of the government.





Yurinka: Alrighty. Regarding your part of the job.
Have you noticed any strange movements on the base since
we discussed the plan... eh, when was it?



Ola: Exactly a week ago. We were throwing a party to
celebrate we finally had something useful to do.
Were you so wasted you forgot?



Yurinka: I have never drank a single sip of alcohol!
And you should quit it too. I don't like you, but it
would be a waste for someone so young to...



Markus: The Yacht has arrived ahead of time. Might be
a last minute maneuver to avoid surveillance.
Yurinka: Let's go! Let's go!



Yurinka: Whoa. Between the fancy van and now this,
our patron must have gotten a huge injection of capital
from the States of Libreland. 
&background IMG/MOT008.PCX


???: Welcome, youngsters. Pardon my early arrival.
The passcode is "Borscht with Calamari"




Yurinka: The passcode is "Pickled herrings with chorizo"





Walter: My name is Walter. I bring the good news
from our patron, still sitting on the high castle.
The operation is going to be probable the most 
&sprite IMG/SPRWAL.PCX


risky endeavour the organization, scarce in resources
and talent, but the rewards might be of infinite value.

&music OGG/RIVER.OGG


As you might already now, the government is investing
on creative ways to spy on their opressed people, 
and technology is advancing in exponential rates



since our government won the space race a handful of
decades ago. But when the power is in hands of a few
bureaucrats, it is prone to be used in villanous,



corrupt ways. The newest superpower this new explosion
of technologies is bringing to our tyrant overlords is
a chip the size of a pea.



Yurinka: Is it a new model of the pocket transmitters?
and will it be so awesome everyone will have one on their
pockets, and the government will spy on us permanently?



Ola: Don't be ridiculous! No one would willingly
carry a spy device in their pocket everywhere they go.




Yurinka: Why do you always have to interrupt me
when I talk, you bratty kid?
Shut up and let adults talk about adult stuff!



Walter: Anyways. It is true the story is about
a device spying on us, but it won't be done in
the light of the day. The means are more perverse.
&background IMG/STO001.PCX


Strong intel is suspecting the government has developed
a diminutive transmitter that requires near zero energy
to operate, and can be integrated on pretty much all



things, live or inanimate. Think about daily objects,
your pets, your shoes whenever you step on bubble gum,
if the government had not banned bubble gum.
&background IMG/STO002.PCX


The patron is willing to put whatever resources
are necessary to equip your organization with tools
to adquire the new technology before the government



starts producing it on mass scale and deploying
it everywhere. Think about how many people the ministry
of happiness could vanish for just criticizing the



opression they suffer. The organization would be
done forever if they turn every corner, every inch
of the country into a monitored, surveilled area!



Yurinka: That's terrifying. But do we have the 
skills to actually do that. Like, in real life?
One thing is to eat donuts and hack radio signals...



Don't you guys hear a buzzing sound on the background?
Did we get a wasp inside the yacht or something?
I hate wasps! Do we have insecticide?



Ola: I think these are not wasps...
Look behind us...




Yurinka: Holy cow! How long have we been
followed by these? We are screwed if we can't
outrun these drones! 
&background IMG/MOT009.PCX


Walter: The patron has already warned me 
about the lack of experience of the team, but how
in earth did you get tracked by drones



minutes after we started moving? Is as if they
already knew our location and path before we even
onboarded. How could this have happened?



Markus: We were discreet discussing the plan at
any times. Although if I make memory, I recall
a moment a week ago when...



Ola: Yeah, what a bummer. Going to the river
and not even bringing a couple of bottles of 
booze? So you said the location was precisely
&background IMG/MOT011.PCX


in front of the old medieval crane, at 
18:45, and we will advance southernwest, right?
Hiccs! I should have not taken these sips of



tequila ahead of this meeting. But you guys
are soooo boring guys.




Markus: Miss Ola. We are lucky I reviewed
the perimeter and no one is spying on us. 
That information is sensitive and we should not



discuss it openly without using keywords...
Please refrain from shouting these details 
again and please refrain from tequila before meetings...



Walter: Please, team. Tell me you made sure 
nothing on the perimeter was actually recording the
conversation, and this is an unfortunate coincidence.
&background IMG/MOT008.PCX
&sprite IMG/SPRWAL.PCX

Markus: Sir. I am in charge of the security of the
base, and can assure you no stranger or strange
object has penetrated inside the base
&background IMG/MOT008.PCX
&sprite IMG/SPRMAR.PCX

Although now that I think about it, there
was indeed something that infiltrated the base
precisely a couple of weeks ago...



I was performing a cleanup of the kitchen,
when I noticed a poor creature that had perished
probably a short time before, so I decided to 
&background IMG/STO003.PCX


deposit it on some place in absence of a 
proper trash bin, which we don't have at the
moment due to shortage of funds...



Walter: Markus, with all due respect, think
about what we were discussing right now...
The mouse WAS the spying device!
&background IMG/MOT008.PCX
&sprite IMG/SPRWAL.PCX

Markus: ....





Yurinka: Hey guys. We utterly screwed, but
are we going to do something with "that" stuff
that is STILL flying above us?
&background IMG/MOT010.PCX


Markus: I think they are deliberately chasing
us to a place out of sight to start firing at us...
The government wants to stick to the narrative



about crime not existing on BaltycMorsk, so
they would prefer to eliminate us on a sneaky
way, then claim the yacht has sunken by itself...



Yurinka: I have never hacked a drone before,
but if it's either that or being blown into 
pieces. I might aswell try to save the day!
&background IMG/MOT012.PCX


... so sudo here. Init here. Editing some
text file here. Saving changes. How the hell
do I exit vi? Argh. Ok, we are out!



Hurray! They were so incompetent to use
root/root as the passwords on the radiofrequency
control. I am uploading through radionet



a different version of the software they run,
and they might just crash into the river!




Ola: Sounds too good to be true...
And what's exactly the software you uploaded into
the drone's control system?



Yurinka: It's BLOOM! The game that was just
released and runs everywhere. It's a port of BLOOM
to run in drones. Ain't that cool?



Ola: ....





Drone: "Segfault. Aborting current operations"





Yurinka: Suck that, my alcoholic nemesis!
It took me a minute to defeat these drones with 
my prowess and ingenuity. Mwahahahahah...



Drone: Loading failsafe defaults.





Yurinka: ....





Drone: Initiating destruction mode.
Please evacuate the perimeter. The drone will start
firing to every living target in sight.
&background IMG/MOT013.PCX


Yurinka: Oh boys. It was too good to be true.
I think we all screwed up on this operation after all...
May god be with us...!
