This is the city of Baltycmorsk. Sitting on the western border
of the former Popular Union. Nowadays, a foreigner would
assume, looking at its pretty 19th century landscape



and luxurious skyscrappers, that its people is  
thriving on a happy, careless life devoid of the
perils of yesteryear.



Such is the joy of the citizens of the 
Union of Republics!, the forefront of world
progress, where poverty and crime are nothing



but a memory of a brutish, backwards past.
Children play on its centenarian streets.
The old is never lonely!



The working class is nowadays enjoying the delights
of the modern world, dominated by the hottest
technologies.

There is only a little "perk" to enjoy the safety and
niceties of this wonderful society on this wonderful
city.

Do not dare to complain! The ministry of happiness
has deployed a complex network of "agents" to help the
dreadful wherever they might be needed.



In every pintoresque corner of this city, 
the government will ensure that you feel protected and
that no crime whatsoever can ever occur.



In recent years. Violence and crime rates have plumetted
to near zero. Our generous government is now tackling 
the problem of sadness that unfortunately still affects



A minority of the population. Do not think our benevolent
state has forgotten the pain whithin the sad and the unwell.
Together, we will succeed on the enterprise of ensuring



we all live in harmony and peace. Both with each other
and with ourselves!
How is the government dealing with this issue you may think?



That's a nice question!
Take a look to this crew of heroes:

Our popular republic has formed and deployed
a team of specialists whose life mission is to find
those in despair and enroll them on spiritual awakening



holidays. Thus helping them to move on with their life
and ensuring their intrusive thoughs can never pose any
peril for the common citizen.



But the sign of times is changing, and the slavic nation
faces its greatest danger!

Armed by foreign powers, lurking on the shadows and surviving
on the scraps obtained through the most despicable means, 
an unit of sabotage has arised. While the forces of law



will always keep their promise of making this
the safest country in the world, the government of the people
needs today your help.

If you ever detect suspicious activities aimed at undermining
the stability of this our government, or disturb the peaceful
lives of its people, do not hesitate to ping the government

Together we can make this a prosperous and safe nation!

Jesus! I don't even remember where the fridge was.
I think it's time to take a little break and source



Some... hmmm.. provisions.

Nice idea. I don't recall where it was tho.





I doubt there is any food on the control room.
