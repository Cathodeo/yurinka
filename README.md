# Yurinka

Yurinka is a point-and-click game where every room is identified by an integer (room ID) and contains up to 3 objects. When the mouse hovers over an object, an option appears, and actions can be performed with a left-click. The game is being developed using Allegro and runs on MS-DOS.

A preview of the first chapter is available.
(It can also be compiled at this point)
