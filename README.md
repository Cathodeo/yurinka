# Yurinka

Yurinka is a point-and-click game developed in C with the library Allegro 4.22.
The gameplay (WIP) consists on Point and Click puzzles, choose your adventure narrative
and (Planned) card battles.

The story describes a parody of a distopian socialist regime, but does not
take itself seriously at any point.
